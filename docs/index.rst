Welcome to Streampie
====================

`Streampie` is a tiny library for simple and parallel execution of job processing tasks. The project heavily draws both concepts and code from the awesome `stream.py <http://www.trinhhaianh.com/stream.py/>`_ project by Anh Hai Trinh. However, it is a leaner, cleaner re-implementation with the addition of simple distributed computation.

`Streampie` is released under the :ref:`MIT License <license>`.
